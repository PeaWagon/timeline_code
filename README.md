# timeline_code
This code can be used to analyse files generated by VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) using the Timeline plugin for secondary structure. Currently, this code is set-up to work with the protein ProP; specifically, it analyses the secondary structure of the c-terminus in *E. coli* (Ec) and *X. campestris* (Xc).

## running and requirements
This code is written in python 3. There are two parts to the code: timelineMain_v\*.py and functionsTimeline_v\*.py, where \* indicates the version number. To run the code, go to where your timeline files (extension .tml) are stored using either command prompt (windows) or the terminal (linux/mac). Type "python timelineMain_v\*.py" and press enter. Respond to the prompts as given. If you wish to quit the program at any time, type "q" and press enter.
