# IMPORTANT: this code needs at least python3.4 to be installed since
# it calls the statistics library, which was not introduced in earlier
# python versions.

# LINK: https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.StatisticsError

# Note: the path to the python file may be different for your system. 
# Note: all of the functions for this program are stored
# in functionsTimeline.py. This file needs to be in the same place as 
# the timelineMain.py program.

# NOTES FROM 21 JUNE:

# Need to add ability to choose segment IDs and amino acid ranges.
# Aka first segment = PROA
# amino acid range for PROA = 4-33 or 1-36 etc.
# DONE! :)

# NOTES FROM 22 JUNE:

# Need to enable filling in a path for the file. Aka so you don't need
# to be in the same directory as the file for it to be opened with this 
# code. Should do this last because it's not as important.

# Should probably add the filename to part of the class. Right now it gets
# referenced a whole lot and thus my code _could_ be more efficient.

# NOTES FROM 26 JUNE:

# Added filename and a few others to the class. The get name and get 
# directory functions are still outside of the class. This organization
# is needed to prevent errors initializing the class.

# I also added the feature that checks to see if the given directory
# actually contains the file that the person wants to check.

# Later on I need to improve the get_name function. This function
# is way too long and annoying. It should be looped.
# I also need a way to check if the format (i.e. does the range have
# a hyphen), and allow for the user to input again rather than
# closing the program abruptly.

# NOTES FROM 27 JUNE, 2016

# Made function get_res to reference is_valid function. If the user inputs
# a range that does not include the residue they want stats on, they will
# get an error.

# Need a warning if no matching full_id was found in the document.
# aka user input is consistent throughout program but their file
# does not contain any info on the segment they specified.

# Still need to improve get_name function. I think I will make sr
# a list and the length of said list will determine how many unique
# segments there are.

# NOTES FROM 28 JUNE, 2016

# Done the is_valid function.
# Done improving get_info function. It is now a part of the class.
# Note to self: can update a list in the object's list of self.thingies.

# There is no warning needed because the code now counts the number
# of lines matching a given residue ID (if the number is zero something
# really bad has happened or the person didn't put the right info
# into the get_info). 

# NOTES FROM 29 JUNE, 2016

# I have done the residue statistics. If I want, I can add a part to 
# tell you which frames correspond to the maximum secondary structure 
# phase (aka residue spent a maximum of 12 frames as a helix, and these
# frames are 1-12)

# The only way to improve this system right now would be to add a
# feature to pull the information from the file about the residue 
# ranges and segment IDs (that way you don't have to know them
# in order to analyse a file).

# Before I do more error checks, I'm going to add a loop so you can 
# analyse multiple residues before you are reprompted to enter a 
# simulation name.

# Done loop. Now the user can analyse multiple residues individually.
